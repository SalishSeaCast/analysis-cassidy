# Example configuration file for `reshapr extract` sub-command
# to resample day-averaged fields to month-averaged

dataset:
  model profile: SalishSeaCast-202111-salish.yaml
  time base: day
  variables group: physics tracers

dask cluster: salish_cluster.yaml

start date: 2015-01-01
end date: 2015-12-31

extract variables:
  - vosaline
  - votemper

resample:
  # A pandas time series frequency offset alias with an optional multiplier digit prefix
  # For monthly resampling use MS so that time values are mid-month.
  time interval: 1MS
  # A xarray dataset reduction method to use for aggregation.
  # See the "resampling and grouped operations" subsection in the Time Series Data
  # section of the xarray User Guide.
  # default: mean
  aggregation: mean
